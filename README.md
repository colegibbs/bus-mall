### Bus-Mall 10

In this lab I created a webpage that acts as a moc product approvement test. The site displays three picture of different product. The same product will not appear more than once on the page. Every time the user picks an image three new products are loaded in and the item gets an upvote. There is also a count for how many times a product is displayed. At the bottom of the screen there is a button that will display how often the item was viewed and how many upvotes it got. In JS I used a constructor, a render function, and two event listeners.

When I don't get what I want out of something when coding, I like to slow way down. I usually start with what errors I'm getting and if there aren't any, I follow the logic as closely as I can until I find the problem. That quote is true. I don't really remember or understand something as well if it is easy something. I guess it depends on the details. Today I learned how to interact with images using the DOM in JS. I also learned about the grid in css which I haven't used yet, but I'm excited to. I'm going to have to do a lot of css work between this class and my next one. I feel that styling doesn't come naturally to me. I don't know if I'll every be really good at it, but I think I can get decent at it if I focus on it for a week or so. I can be confusing and difficult to understand sometimes why one action made a particular box move in a very unexpected way.

### Reflections and Comments 11

Today I learned how to use a third party library called chart.js. It is so useful to have something like a library at your disposal. It saved me a bunch of time I would have used to create a chart and looks a lot better than what I have the ability to make. I thought it was going to be really difficult to integrate the third party into my code, but it was surprisingly straight forward. I'm sure that there are many more libraries that are reliable resources. Reading the documentation on the libraries is probably pretty important if I had to guess. You're reading and using someone else's code, so you need some guidance so you know what's going on. I can't think of anything that I thought was going to be easy that was hard in this course. I've mostly expected everything to be difficult. I did think that css was going to be easier than it is, but other than that I'be expected most topics, especially JS to be difficult and I'm pleasantly surprised if I have an easier time with a topic. Using chart.js makes me curious about React. What are the similarities in use? What is the difference between a framework and a library?
